# Man-in-the-middle-attack-using-ARP-Poisoning

This project was done as part of my intern program in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security at Azure Skynet. As an extension I had used this project with modifications in my undergraduate course study and had published a research paper in the IJCSE journal.

Summary of the Project:

The main objective of this project is about how does real time Man in the Middle (MITM) Attacks takes place using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning over a specific LAN (or) Ethernet in the field of cyber security. The process of APR Poisoning is applicable only to the 'HTTP' browser sites where any personal information like authorization details entered by a user can be captured and can be viewed on the local hosts desktop through a graphical interface called "Ettercap-G".

The attack takes place when there is a communication between the client and the server and this happens when a malicious actor inserts himself as a proxy into a communication system and tries to manipulate the Physical Address of the router using the spoofing technique which on the back end runs on Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). Due to this exploitation of real time processing of transactions, conversations or other transfer of data can happen.

In this process instead of considering router Media Access Control (MAC) address this project takes the remote hosts IP address and then the router address, thereby partitioning them into two groups and then start the poisoning. This leads to the change in physical address of router which is to be known that the attack has been take placed. This entire technique gives a brief note on how does attack takes place using ARP Poisoning.

Softwares Used:

i) Operating System: Windows, Kali Linux

ii) Version: Above Windows XP Version

iii) GUI Tool: Ettercap-G

iv) Platform Used: Virtual Machine Ware (VMWare) Workstation 12 Player, Text Editor as IDE in Kali Linux

v) Programming Language Used: C

"Project Report.pdf" : This file navigates through different stages in the development of the project and also gives a clear outline on how is the Ettercap tool used for performing the MITM attack. Also there is a detailed explanation about the source code in the Appendix section of the report on how each stage of the attack is being processed.

"IJCSE Research Paper.pdf" : This is a supportive document where I was requested by the undergraduate university to publish a research paper as there were good end results and findings obtained from the project. 

Accordingly I had published a research paper titled "Command line and Graphical Interface comparative analysis for ARP Poisoning through Ettercap". This paper basically explains the methodologies that are followed to perform this attack using the Command Line Interface (CLI) methodolody and Graphical User Interface (GUI) methodology. As an end result of this analysis I had concluded that GUI based tools perform much more faster operations than the traditional CLI methods.
